# TODO

## Proto Generator Code

- Change the enum code to first gather all the visible enums, then, separately,
  match each occurrence to the closest enum in the full list. Look at subsets.

- Generate *Request/*Response objects, as well as wrappers for pairs of them,
  and a Log message that's essentially a list of a oneof of the pairs.

- Generate sub-messages for each of the inner "object" instances (currently not
  generated) and break them out at the top-level. These are nameless; find a way
  to match them up and reconcile for deduplication.

- Files:

    messges.proto : Top-level request/response objects.
    enums.proto   : All enums, deduplicated.
    data.proto    : Inner objects.

## Streaming API

- Create a schema corresponding to the streaming API by hand, for which there
  isn't much of a published website schema.

## Doc

Integrade doc like this into our enums:
